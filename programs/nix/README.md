# Nix Program Configuration

Contains Nix-specific program configurations and dotfiles.

## Purpose

Houses configuration files for the Nix package manager itself, including nix.conf settings, registry entries, and other Nix-related configurations that aren't managed directly through NixOS or Home Manager modules.
